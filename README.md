# hotel-management-systems

This repository is a collection of sample technical documentation used for managing room reservations and guest check-in. check-out processes. Included are sample manuals, SOPs, and guides that explain system functionality and processes. The documentation leverages industry-standard formats to ensure reusability and compatibility with content management systems. My aim was to bridge the gap between hotel operations and technical documentation, based on my experience in the hospitality industry.
