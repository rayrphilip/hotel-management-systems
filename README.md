# Project Overview

This repository is a collection of sample technical documentation used for managing hotel room reservations and guest check-in and check-out processes. Included are sample manuals, SOPs, and guides that explain system functionality and processes. The documentation leverages industry-standard formats to ensure reusability and compatibility with content management systems. My aim was to bridge the gap between hotel operations and technical documentation, based on my experience in the hospitality industry.

# Repository Structure

- **/docs/manuals/**: Markdown files containing sample manuals for hotel management system usage
- **/docs/sops/**: XML files with sample SOPs for operational tasks, such as guest check-in procedures
- **/docs/dita/**: DITA files providing modular documentation for reservation system components
- **/docs/guides/**: A PDF user guide consolidating all content for end-uesrs
- **/scripts/**: An XSLT stylesheet for transforming XML SOPs into HTML
- **/templates/**: A Word document template for standardized documentation formatting
- **/samples/**: A Markdown glossary of hospitality-related terms
- **/images/**: A flowchart depicting the guest check-in process

# Usage Instructions

Navigate the repository folders to explore the sample documentation. Markdown files can be viewed in any text editor, while XML and DITA files are compatible with tools like Oxygen XML Editor. The PDF guide requires a PDF reader, and diagrams in /assets/images/ enhance the documentation's clarity. The XSLT script enables transformation of XML content for alternative outputs.
